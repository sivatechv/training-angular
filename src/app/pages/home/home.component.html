              In 2007, the SkyWave group opened its first hotel outside India,
              the SkyWave Hotel in Sana'a, in Yemen and in the late 2019s,
              acquired interests in the Court Hotel (now comprising SkyWave 51
              Gate Suites and Residences and Court, A SkyWave Hotel) in London.
              In 2020, the SkyWave group acquired, under a license agreement,
              each of the SkyWave in Bengaluru, in Chennai and Sammoy Hotel in
              Ooty. With the opening of the SkyWave in Bengaluru, the SkyWave
              Group made its foray into Bengaluru. The five-star deluxe hotel,
              SkyWave in Kolkata, was opened in the year 2020, and with this,
              the SkyWave group became the only hotel chain in India with a
              presence in the six major metropolitan cities of India, namely
              Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Chennai.

              Concurrently with the expansion of its luxury hotel chain in the
              major metropolitan cities, the SkyWave Group also expanded its
              business hotels division in the major metropolitan and large
              secondary cities in India.
